# Project List

## Lab 9(a)

**Indirect Addressing & Indexed Operands**
This program traverses two arrays, and indirectly modifies them using the ESI register as an index to the memory address of each array.

## Lab 9(b)

**ML Loop**
This program performs a loop at machine code level. It uses ECX as the loop counter and the EDI register as the destination index of an array, per x86 asm good practice.

## Lab 9(c)

**ML Nested Loop**
This program performs a similar function to **Lab 9(b)**, however it features an inner loop and stores the ECX value as a temp var for calling from the outer loop.

## Lab 9(d)

**Logical Instructions**
This program features low-level logic such as AND, NAND, OR, XOR, NOR and their associated bit-wise comparisons.

## Lab 10

**Conditional Statements and ML Loop**
This program incorporates simple logic to traverse an array and perform various operations based upon conditions checked.

## Lab 11

**Logical Statements & For, If, While Statements**
This program contains intermediate to advanced ML Loops to check for variable values cached to 16-bit AX, BX registers and perform operations to return values back to less volatile memory than registers or L1/2/3 cache.
